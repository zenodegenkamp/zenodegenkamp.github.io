					<h1 id="text02">Hi, I&#39;m Zeno Degenkamp.</h1>
					<hr id="divider02">
					<p id="text01"><span>👋🏼 My name is Zeno, an ambitious young professional with a background in both business and IT. I am passionate about combining the best of both worlds in the role of Product Owner.

🎓I hold a Master's degree in Entrepreneurship from the Free University of Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Amsterdam. I also have a minor in programming. These experiences have given me a deep understanding of entrepreneurship, business strategies, marketing, digital commerce, human resource management, and the fundamentals of programming.

💼 After graduating from my Master's program, I put my knowledge into practice at Telesuper and Coop. I held various roles, including team leader, IT tester, and coordinator/implementer of IT projects. This experience taught me valuable leadership skills, agile working in a SCRUM framework, deep insights into IT testing processes, and the ability to effectively manage complex IT projects.

🌍After this phase, I embarked on an 8-month adventure in Asia. I immersed myself in diverse cultures and gained valuable global insights. This experience also strengthened my adaptability, independence, and problem-solving skills.

🚀 Upon my return, I decided to further improve my IT skills. I followed a Front-end Developer Career Path from Scrimba and took a Design Thinking course from Growth Tribe. These courses expanded my technical expertise and gave me a better understanding of design thinking. I also obtained the PSPO 1 and PSM 1 scrum certifications.

📩I am currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my unique mix of business acumen, IT skills, and interest in the role of Product Owner. I am passionate about working on innovative products that make a positive impact on the world. </span><br /><span>In my spare time a starting developer.</span></p>
